# Oh hey, we're Aperture! ðŸ“·

## But what actually is Aperture?
*Aperture is an organisation* created by me ([benjisqt](https://github.com/benjisqt)), on a whim.<br/>

> **The main goal of Aperture and what we aspire to create is Android alternatives to Apple's "walled garden" ecosystem.**<br/>

This includes features on iPhone, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch and others, including:<br/>
- AirDrop.
- Native system-wide iCloud compatibility.
- Potential Apple Watch pairing compatibility.
- Seamless integration with AirPods.
- Find My ecosystem compatibility (devices, people, keys, AirTags).
- Copy and paste between Android devices on your Google account.
- Official FaceTime client app (instead of the weird website)
- Seamless sharing of Wi-Fi passwords to other devices on your Google account.
- Seamless sharing of Wi-Fi passwords to other Android devices near you via Bluetooth.
- Easy transferring of iCloud Keychain passwords to Google/Samsung Pass.
- Synchronising iCloud and Google Calendar to keep both up to date if you have other Apple devices.

**As may be clear**, we have *a lot* to achieve, and a lot to do to achieve these goals.<br/>
**However, that's what I made Aperture for.** *To finally let users break free and explore other options if they want to, knowing that they will still have their precious Apple ecosystem in their pocket.*
